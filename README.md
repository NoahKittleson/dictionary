##**Description**##
This is a basic web app that allows the user to enter in words, which will be displayed as a list on the homepage.  The user can then click on any of the words that they have submitted and it will take them to a new page where they can enter definitions to their own words.

##**Setup**##
Clone the repository or otherwise download the source files to your computer.  Within the terminal navigate to the Dictionary file and run gradle.  This should set up a local server so that you can view the webpage on any modern browser at localhost:4567.
